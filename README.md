# Ethical Hacking Penetration Testing Project

🔒 **Comprehensive SME Network Security Assessment**

## Overview
Professional penetration testing conducted on a simulated SME network environment following PTES methodology. This project demonstrates various cybersecurity techniques including reconnaissance, vulnerability assessment, and exploitation.
Simulated a full-scale penetration test on a virtual SME network using the Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES). Identified critical vulnerabilities across desktops, servers, and web applications using open-source tools. Delivered actionable security recommendations to improve organizational resilience.

## 🎯 Key Findings
- **Exploited MS17-010 EternalBlue** on Windows 7 desktop
- **Cracked user passwords** using John the Ripper and Hydra
- **Bypassed web authentication** and escalated privileges
- **Identified critical vulnerabilities** across network infrastructure

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques Used
- **Metasploit Framework** - Exploitation
- **Nmap** - Network scanning
- **Hydra** - Password cracking  
- **John the Ripper** - Hash cracking
- **Netdiscover** - Network discovery

## 📋 Network Targets
| IP Address | System | Status |
|------------|--------|--------|
| 192.168.10.20 | Windows 7 Desktop | ✅ Compromised |
| 192.168.10.10 | CentOS Server | ✅ Compromised |
| 192.168.10.30 | Kali Linux (Attacker) | 🎯 Attack Machine |

## 🔍 Methodology (PTES)
1. **Pre-engagement** - Scope & Authorization
2. **Intelligence Gathering** - Network reconnaissance  
3. **Vulnerability Analysis** - System scanning
4. **Exploitation** - Active exploitation
5. **Post-Exploitation** - Privilege escalation
6. **Reporting** - Documentation & recommendations

## 📈 Results Summary
- **Total Vulnerabilities:** 15+
- **Critical Issues:** 5
- **Systems Compromised:** 2/2
- **Passwords Cracked:** 6
